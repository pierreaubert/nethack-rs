# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Neutral & Clear:** Documentation, code comments, and user-facing messages should prioritize clarity and accessibility.
- **Direct Communication:** Avoid unnecessary jargon or overly thematic language that might obscure technical details or gameplay mechanics.
- **WASM/Blockchain Specificity:** When documenting decentralized features, use precise terminology to assist developers working with Polkadot and smart contracts.

## Visual Identity
- **Adaptive & Versatile:** The design system must support a wide spectrum of representations, from classic ASCII/Unicode symbols in the TUI to high-fidelity graphical tiles in the Bevy frontend.
- **Consistent Information Hierarchy:** Regardless of the frontend, the way information (health, inventory, messages) is presented should remain consistent to ensure player familiarity across platforms.
- **Scalability:** Assets and layouts must be designed to work effectively across different resolutions and display types, including terminal windows and web browsers.

## Brand Messaging
- **Faithful Modernization:** Always communicate the project as a "Faithful Modernization" of NetHack 3.6.x. 
- **The "NetHack in Rust" Promise:** Emphasize the core values: functional parity with the original game, significantly improved performance, and a modern, modular architecture that opens new doors for developers and players.
- **Bridge to Decentralization:** Highlight the unique capability of running the engine on Polkadot as a natural evolution of the game's portability and robustness.
